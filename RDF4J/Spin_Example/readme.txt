!!! This sample works ONLY with Virtuoso 8 and above !!!

1) Use this command to compile the sample program:

      gradlew clean build

2) Use this command to run the sample program:

      gradlew run


**NOTE 1**  
The example connects to a Virtuoso instance on 
localhost port 1111, with userid and password 
both "dba". To connect to a different Virtuoso 
server instance or use different credentials, 
you will need to edit the file "build.gradle", 
and change the args ['{hostname or IP address}', 
'{port number}', '{username}', '{password}'] to 
suit your target instance.

...
run {
args = ['localhost', '1111', 'dba', 'dba']
}
...


**NOTE 2** 
Most of the demo's requirements are contained in 
the zip file. gradle will automatically download 
any missing dependencies when the demo is run for 
the first time, so youâ€™ll need an active internet 
connection at that time.
