This is a collection of sample Java-based applications for interacting with Virtuoso that covers important areas such as:

1. Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) interaction modalities -- initial examples
2. JDBC Benchmarking 
3. Data Connectivity that extends across a "Web of Data" and/or Knowledge Graph contructed from hyperlinks in line with Linked Data principles -- to be added
4. Many others, as we grow this repository
